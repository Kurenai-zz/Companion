# Companion
Free Enterprise Companion
A auto-tracker for Free Enterprise, a Final Fantasy IV randomizer.

This is created as an external tool for BizHawk. To install, just copy the dll to BizHawk/ExternalTools.

Please note that no assests of Final Fantasy IV are included in this software, as it reads the sprites it uses from the ROM loaded in BizHawk.

Also, due to pulling sprites from the ROM, this tracker is not technically legal for races until it receives approval.

Future goals / additions to the tracker:
- Detect Kamikaze kills on zeromus
- Detect win:game event
- Tooltips.
- Discord integration (auto .done, auto get seed, etc)
- Twitch integration (twitch add-on eventually)
