# Free Enterprise Companion
An auto-tracker for Free Enterprise, a Final Fantasy IV randomizer.

This is created as an external tool for BizHawk 2.8.

To install, just copy the dll to BizHawk/ExternalTools/.

Free Enterprise Companion was primarily tested with either the BSNES or BSNESv115+ cores included in BizHawk 2.8. snes9X core has some issues that need to be resolved.

Please note that no assests of Final Fantasy IV are included in this software, as it reads the sprites it uses from the ROM loaded in BizHawk.

Also, due to pulling sprites from the ROM, this tracker is not technically legal for races until it receives approval.

Future goals / additions to the tracker:
- Detect Kamikaze kills on zeromus
- Detect win:game event
- Mystery seed mode.
- More Tooltips.
- Discord integration (show available asyncs, auto download seeds, etc)
- Twitch integration (twitch add-on eventually)
